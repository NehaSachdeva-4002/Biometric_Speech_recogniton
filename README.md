# 🔐 Voice Biometric Authentication + 🎯 Sentiment-Based Quote Recommendation

This project fuses **voice biometric authentication** with a **sentiment-aware quote recommender**, giving users a secure and personalized experience. Users register and log in using **just their voice**, and once authenticated, receive quotes tailored to their **mood or input** — via **text or speech**.
